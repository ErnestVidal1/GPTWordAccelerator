    "title": "Installation",
    "description": "Users will receive an empty XML file with the required meta tags and other necessary fields for archiving solutions. To increase transparency and trust, it is recommended to install AutoHotkey (AHK) independently, and the necessary open-source code will be provided for users to paste into a new AHK file. Detailed instructions will be included to facilitate this process."

  "definitionNeeds": {
    "title": "Define Your Needs",
    "description": "Users will define the current needs of the Word document they wish to automate with a VBA macro, detailing the specific modifications they need to implement through interactive forms in the webapp."
  },
  "searchPreviousMacros": {
    "title": "Search Previous Macros",
    "description": "Users will search their own XML repository, which contains macros from previous layout processes. This search will be facilitated by a tag tree, and through AHK shortcuts, users will be able to send whole tag nodes directly to ChatGPT to find an appropriate base macro or iterate in the search for subtags and descriptions until the most appropriate macro is found."

  "macroDevelopment": {
    "title": "Macro Development",
    "description": "If an appropriate macro is found, it will be sent to ChatGPT along with the user's requirements. In the webapp, a dropdown will provide multiple pre-recorded prompts with shortcuts to optimize and expedite communication with ChatGPT. The code generated by ChatGPT will be automatically sent to the Word VBA editor via an AHK shortcut. The user will act as a tester, providing feedback to ChatGPT on errors or confirmation of operation, in a continuous communicative cycle where ChatGPT acts as the programmer."

  "finalizationArchive": {
    "title": "Finalization and Archiving",
    "description": "After multiple iterations and feedback, once the macro is successful, it will be tagged with metadata and automatically archived in the XML file using an AHK shortcut. The success of the storage will be confirmed with a message that includes the macro ID, ensuring that the process is transparent and efficient."
